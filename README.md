# **New York House Rent Prediction Project**

## Overview
Welcome to the captivating world of New York City house rents! üè†‚ú® While this project draws inspiration from existing knowledge (including a book), I've infused it with creativity and innovation. Let's dive into the details:

1. **The Dual Approach**:
   - Instead of treating the entire dataset as a monolithic entity, I've split it into two distinct realms:
     - **Residential Rentals**: For those seeking cozy apartments, condos, and comfortable living spaces.
     - **Commercial Rentals**: Tailored specifically for workspaces‚Äîoffices, storefronts, and commercial properties.

2. **Why Divide?** üåü
   - **Customization**: Each customer has unique needs. By segmenting the dataset, I can provide more accurate predictions based on intent.
   - **Real-World Scenarios**: People don't just rent homes; they seek bustling offices or serene studios. Our models reflect this reality.
   - **Creativity Unleashed**: Even with existing knowledge, there's room for innovation. Dividing the dataset allows us to tailor solutions.

## The Journey Ahead

Let's explore the project roadmap:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Clean, transform, and engineer features.
   - Split data into residential and commercial subsets‚Äîeach with its own flavor.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Separate models for residential and commercial rentals.
   - We'll dance with machine learning algorithms‚ÄîRandom Forest, Linear Regression, and more.

3. **Evaluation and Fine-Tuning**:
   - Metrics matter! We'll assess model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
   - Iteratively polish our models like skilled artisans.

4. **Documentation**:
   - You're reading the README‚Äîa gateway to our project.
   - Installation instructions, usage guidelines, and credits await curious minds.

## How to Embark on This Journey
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Your adventure begins with a `git clone`. Bring this project to life on your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Python and essential libraries (Pandas, Scikit-Learn) are your trusty companions.
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`‚Äîthe magic spell to summon them.

3. **Explore the Notebooks**:
   - Delve into Jupyter notebooks (`residential_rent.ipynb` and `commercial_rent.ipynb`).
   - Witness data preprocessing, model training, and the dance of algorithms.

4. **Predict Rents**:
   - Input features‚Äîbedrooms, bathrooms, location.
   - Let our trained models conjure rental estimates tailored to your desires.
